> dockerfile for tauri android toolchain

WARN: this is not actively maintained, honestly a pretty hacky solution but it makes it possible to easily reproduce builds across environments (i.e. clouds) and that's enough for me.
Here be dragons and whatnot.

It's probably a good idea to fork your own version if you're considering to go this route. Feel free to use this as a starting point, suggestions and prs are also always welcome.

I based this on https://github.com/alvr/alpine-android and https://github.com/bell-sw/Liberica
